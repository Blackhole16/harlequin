harlequin
=========

Dark, high contrast gvim colorscheme inspired by [molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai) and [badwolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf).

characteristics
---------------

- warm colors
- trying not to get too many very different colors to appear in close proximity
- no bright colors in the areas around the code (status line, line numbers, etc.)
- legible comments (not the light grey comments on a grey background of molokai/badwolf)

contribute
----------

Pull requests welcome. Please open issues if you find something that looks wonky in your language or your plugin.
